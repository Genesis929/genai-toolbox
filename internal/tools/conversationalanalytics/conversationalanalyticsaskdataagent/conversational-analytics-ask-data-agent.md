## About

A `conversational-analytics-ask-data-agent` tool allows you to ask questions about
your data in natural language.

This function takes a user's question (which can include conversational history
for context) and references to a specific BigQuery Data Agent, and sends them to a
stateless conversational API.

The API uses a GenAI agent to understand the question, generate and execute SQL
queries and Python code, and formulate an answer. This function returns a
detailed, sequential log of this entire process, which includes any generated
SQL or Python code, the data retrieved, and the final text answer.

**Note**: This tool requires additional setup in your project. Please refer to
the official Conversational Analytics API
documentation
for instructions.

It's compatible with the following sources:

- conversational-analytics

`conversational-analytics-ask-data-agent` accepts the following parameters:

- **`user_query_with_context`:** The question to ask the agent, potentially 
  including conversation history for context.
- **`data_agent_id`:** The ID of the data agent to ask.

## Example

```yaml
tools:
  ask_data_agent:
    kind: conversational-analytics-ask-data-agent
    source: my-conversational-analytics-source
